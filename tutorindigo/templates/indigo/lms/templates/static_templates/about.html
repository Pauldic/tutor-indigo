                The 222 <b>National Association of Companion Animal Rescues (NACAR)</b> was founded by a group of experienced animal 
                rescuers who shared a common belief: <b>we can make a greater impact by working together.</b>
                <br/><br/>
                
                For years, each of us operated independently—rescuing animals, supporting shelters, advocating for change, 
                and training volunteers. While our individual efforts made a difference, we recognized a larger need within 
                the rescue community: <b>unified leadership, stronger standards, and a collaborative voice</b> in the areas of legislation, 
                education, and professional development. <br /><br />
                
                By the end of 2024, it was clear that fragmented efforts were no longer enough. 
                The challenges facing companion animal rescues—ranging from inconsistent care practices to a lack of regulatory support—demanded 
                a coordinated, national approach. And so, we came together to form <b>NACAR</b>, the <b>National Association of Companion Animal Rescues.</b>
                <br/><br/>

                Our mission is simple but powerful: 
                <b>To raise the standard of care in the rescue industry through education, advocacy, and collaboration.</b>
                <br /><br />

                Through NACAR, we offer: 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Professional education and training</b> for rescuers, fosters, and organizations</li>
                    <li><b>Legislative advocacy</b> to promote policies that protect animals and support responsible rescue practices</li>
                    <li><b>A community of like-minded professionals</b> working together to elevate the field of companion animal rescue</li>
                </ul>
                NACAR is more than an organization—it's a movement. A movement toward better practices, stronger partnerships, and a more ethical, effective rescue community.
                <br /><br />

                Join us in setting a higher standard for the animals and people who depend on us.
